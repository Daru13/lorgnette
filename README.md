# Lorgnette

Lorgnette is a framework for augmenting code editors with _malleable code projections_, i.e., alternative representations that are bidirectionally linked to pieces of code (or even runtime data!) and can be created and modified by the users of the code editor.
Lorgnette is a research prototype, currently targeting code editors that run in webpages, such as the [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) and [CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net/).
